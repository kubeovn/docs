# Feature Stage

In Kube-OVN, feature stage is classified into **Alpha**, **Beta** and **GA**, based on the degree of feature usage, documentation and test coverage.

## Definition of Stage

For **Alpha** stage functions:

- The feature is not fully documented and well tested.
- This feature may change or even be removed in the future.
- This feature API is not guaranteed to be stable and may be removed.
- Community provides low priority support for this feature and long-term support cannot be guaranteed.
- Since feature stability and long-term support cannot be guaranteed, it can be tested and verified, but is not recommended for production use.

For **Beta** stage functions:

- This feature is partially documented and tested, but complete coverage is not guaranteed.
- This feature may change in the future and the upgrade may affect the network, but it will not be removed as a whole.
- This feature API may change in the future and the fields may be adjusted, but not removed as a whole.
- This feature will be supported by the community in the long term.
- It can be used on non-critical services as the functionality will be supported for a long time, but it is not recommended for critical production service as there is a possibility of changes in functionality and APIs that may break the network.

For **GA** stage functions:

- The feature has full documentation and test coverage.
- The feature will remain stable and upgrades will be guaranteed to be smooth.
- This feature API is not subject to disruptive changes.
- This feature will be supported with high priority by the community and long-term support will be guaranteed.
