# Kube-OVN API Reference

Based on Kube-OVN v1.12.0, we have compiled a list of CRD resources supported by Kube-OVN, listing the types and meanings of each field of CRD definition for reference.

## Generic Condition Definition

| Property Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | String | Type of status |
| status | String | The value of status, in the range of `True`, `False` or `Unknown` |
