# Config VPC

Kube-OVN supports multi-tenant isolation level VPC networks. Different VPC networks are independent of each other
and can be configured separately with Subnet CIDRs, routing policies, security policies, outbound gateways, EIP, etc.

> VPC is mainly used in scenarios where there requires strong isolation of multi-tenant networks
> and some Kubernetes networking features conflict under multi-tenant networks.
> For example, node and pod access, NodePort functionality, network access-based health checks,
> and DNS capabilities are not supported in multi-tenant network scenarios at this time.
> In order to facilitate common Kubernetes usage scenarios, Kube-OVN has a special design for the default
> VPC where the Subnet under the VPC can meet the Kubernetes specification.
> The custom VPC supports static routing, EIP and NAT gateways as described in this document.
> Common isolation requirements can be achieved through network policies and Subnet ACLs under the default VPC,
> so before using a custom VPC, please make sure whether you need VPC-level isolation and understand the limitations under the custom VPC.
> For Underlay subnets, physical switches are responsible for data-plane forwarding, so VPCs cannot isolate Underlay subnets.

## Creating Custom VPCs

Create two VPCs:

```yaml
kind: Vpc
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: test-vpc-1
spec:
  namespaces:
  - ns1
---
kind: Vpc
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: test-vpc-2
spec:
  namespaces:
    - ns2
```

- `namespaces`: Limit which namespaces can use this VPC. If empty, all namespaces can use this VPC.

Create two Subnets, belonging to two different VPCs and having the same CIDR:

```yaml
kind: Subnet
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: net1
spec:
  vpc: test-vpc-1
  cidrBlock: 10.0.1.0/24
  protocol: IPv4
  namespaces:
    - ns1
---
kind: Subnet
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: net2
spec:
  vpc: test-vpc-2
  cidrBlock: 10.0.1.0/24
  protocol: IPv4
  namespaces:
    - ns2
```

Create Pods under two separate Namespaces:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    ovn.kubernetes.io/logical_switch: net1
  namespace: ns1
  name: vpc1-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: vpc1-pod
      image: docker.io/library/nginx:alpine
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    ovn.kubernetes.io/logical_switch: net2
  namespace: ns2
  name: vpc2-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: vpc2-pod
      image: docker.io/library/nginx:alpine
```

After running successfully, you can observe that the two Pod addresses belong to the same CIDR,
but the two Pods cannot access each other because they are running on different tenant VPCs.

## Create VPC NAT Gateway

> Subnets under custom VPCs do not support distributed gateways and centralized gateways under default VPCs.

Pod access to the external network within the VPC requires a VPC gateway, which bridges the physical and tenant networks and provides floating IP, SNAT and DNAT capabilities.

The VPC gateway function relies on Multus-CNI function, please refer to [multus-cni](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md){: target = "_blank" }.

### Configuring the External Network

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: ovn-vpc-external-network
spec:
  protocol: IPv4
  provider: ovn-vpc-external-network.kube-system
  cidrBlock: 192.168.0.0/24
  gateway: 192.168.0.1  # IP address of the physical gateway
  excludeIps:
  - 192.168.0.1..192.168.0.10
---
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: ovn-vpc-external-network
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  config: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "eth1",
      "mode": "bridge",
      "ipam": {
        "type": "kube-ovn",
        "server_socket": "/run/openvswitch/kube-ovn-daemon.sock",
        "provider": "ovn-vpc-external-network.kube-system"
      }
    }'
```

- This Subnet is used to manage the available external addresses, so please communicate with your network management to give you the available physical segment IPs.
- The VPC gateway uses Macvlan for physical network configuration, and `master` of `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` should be the NIC name of the corresponding physical network NIC.
- `name`: External network name.

For macvlan mode, the nic will send packets directly through that node NIC,
relying on the underlying network devices for L2/L3 level forwarding capabilities. You need to configure the corresponding gateway,
Vlan and security policy in the underlying network device in advance.

1. For OpenStack VM environments, you need to turn off `PortSecurity` on the corresponding network port.
2. For VMware vSwitch networks, `MAC Address Changes`, `Forged Transmits` and `Promiscuous Mode Operation` should be set to `allow`.
3. For Hyper-V virtualization,  `MAC Address Spoofing` should be enabled in VM nic advanced features.
4. Public clouds, such as AWS, GCE, AliCloud, etc., do not support user-defined Mac, so they cannot support Macvlan mode network.
5. Due to the limitations of Macvlan, the Macvlan sub-interface cannot access the parent interface address.
6. If the physical network card corresponds to a switch interface in Trunk mode, a sub-interface needs to be created on the network card and provided to Macvlan for use.

### Enabling the VPC Gateway

VPC gateway functionality needs to be enabled via `ovn-vpc-nat-gw-config` under `kube-system`:

```yaml
---
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ovn-vpc-nat-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  image: docker.io/kubeovn/vpc-nat-gateway:{{ variables.version }}
---
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ovn-vpc-nat-gw-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  enable-vpc-nat-gw: 'true'
```

- `image`: The image used by the Gateway Pod.
- `enable-vpc-nat-gw`: Controls whether the VPC Gateway feature is enabled.

### Create VPC Gateway and Set the Default Route

```yaml
kind: VpcNatGateway
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: gw1
spec:
  vpc: test-vpc-1
  subnet: net1
  lanIp: 10.0.1.254
  selector:
    - "kubernetes.io/hostname: kube-ovn-worker"
    - "kubernetes.io/os: linux"
  externalSubnets:
    - ovn-vpc-external-network
```

- `subnet`: A Subnet within the VPC, the VPC Gateway Pod will use `lanIp` to connect to the tenant network under that subnet.
- `lanIp`: An unused IP within the `subnet` that the VPC Gateway Pod will eventually use for the Pod.
- `selector`: Node selector for the VPC Gateway Pod.
- `lanIp`: Needs to be the same as `nextHopIP`.
- `externalSubnets`: External network used by the VPC gateway, if not configured, `ovn-vpc-external-network` is used by default, and only one external network is supported in the current version.

Other configurable parameters:

- `tolerations`: Configure tolerance for the VPC gateway. For details, see [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#taint-nodes-by-condition)
- `affinity`: Configure affinity for the Pod or node of the VPC gateway. For details, see [Assigning Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)

### Create EIP

EIP allows for floating IP, SNAT, and DNAT operations after assigning an IP from an external network segment to a VPC gateway.

Randomly assign an address to the EIP:

```yaml
kind: IptablesEIP
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: eip-random
spec:
  natGwDp: gw1
```

Fixed EIP address assignment:

```yaml
kind: IptablesEIP
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: eip-static
spec:
  natGwDp: gw1
  v4ip: 10.0.1.111
```

Specify the external network on which the EIP is located:

```yaml
kind: IptablesEIP
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: eip-random
spec:
  natGwDp: gw1
  externalSubnet: ovn-vpc-external-network
```

- `externalSubnet`: The name of the external network on which the EIP is located. If not specified, it defaults to `ovn-vpc-external-network`. If specified, it must be one of the `externalSubnets` of the VPC gateway.

### Create DNAT Rules

```yaml
kind: IptablesEIP
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: eipd01
spec:
  natGwDp: gw1
  
---
kind: IptablesDnatRule
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: dnat01
spec:
  eip: eipd01 
  externalPort: '8888'
  internalIp: 10.0.1.10
  internalPort: '80'
  protocol: tcp
```

### Create SNAT Rules

```yaml
---
kind: IptablesEIP
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: eips01
spec:
  natGwDp: gw1
---
kind: IptablesSnatRule
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: snat01
spec:
  eip: eips01
  internalCIDR: 10.0.1.0/24
```

### Create Floating IP

```yaml
---
kind: IptablesEIP
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: eipf01
spec:
  natGwDp: gw1

---
kind: IptablesFIPRule
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: fip01
spec:
  eip: eipf01
  internalIp: 10.0.1.5
```

## Custom Routing

Within the custom VPC, users can customize the routing rules within the VPC and combine it with the gateway for more flexible forwarding.
Kube-OVN supports static routes and more flexible policy routes.

### Static Routes

```yaml
kind: Vpc
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: test-vpc-1
spec:
  staticRoutes:
    - cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
      nextHopIP: 10.0.1.254
      policy: policyDst
    - cidr: 172.31.0.0/24
      nextHopIP: 10.0.1.253
      policy: policySrc
      routeTable: "rtb1"
```

- `policy`: Supports destination routing `policyDst` and source routing `policySrc`.
- When there are overlapping routing rules, the rule with the longer CIDR mask has higher priority,
  and if the mask length is the same, the destination route has a higher priority over the source route.
- `routeTable`: You can store the route in specific table, default is main table. Associate with subnet please defer to [Create Custom Subnets](subnet.en.md/#_5)

### Policy Routes

Traffic matched by static routes can be controlled at a finer granularity by policy routing.
Policy routing provides more precise matching rules, priority control and more forwarding actions.
This feature brings the OVN internal logical router policy function directly to the outside world, for more information on its use, please refer to [Logical Router Policy](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-nb.5.html#Logical_Router_Policy_TABLE){: target = "_blank" }.

An example of policy routes:

```yaml
kind: Vpc
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: test-vpc-1
spec:
  policyRoutes:
    - action: drop
      match: ip4.src==10.0.1.0/24 && ip4.dst==10.0.1.250
      priority: 11
    - action: reroute
      match: ip4.src==10.0.1.0/24
      nextHopIP: 10.0.1.252
      priority: 10
```

## **Custom VPC Image**

The image used for VPC could be configured via `ovn-vpc-nat-config`  under `kube-system`:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ovn-vpc-nat-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  image: docker.io/kubeovn/vpc-nat-gateway:{{ variables.version }}
```
