# Dual-Stack Network

In KubeVirt's Bridge network mode, the DHCP service is provided by `virt-launcher`. However, KubeVirt currently only implements DHCP for IPv4 single-stack, which prevents KubeVirt VMs in Bridge mode from dynamically obtaining IPv6 addresses through the RA (Router Advertisement) protocol. Although Kube-OVN provides DHCP and RA capabilities, these features are ineffective because KubeVirt intercepts DHCP/RA requests in advance.

In versions of KubeVirt after 1.4.0, a new Network Binding Plugin introduces a Bridge-like network mode called `managedTap`. In this mode, KubeVirt does not intercept DHCP requests. Therefore, by combining the new `managedTap` mode with Kube-OVN's DHCP/RA capabilities, it is possible to automatically obtain dual-stack network addresses for VMs.

## Usage

1. Enable DHCP and IPv6 RA features in the Subnet of Kube-OVN, as shown in the following YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
    kind: Subnet
    metadata:
      name: dual-stack-subnet
    spec:
      cidrBlock: "10.244.0.0/16,fd00:10:244::/64"
      enableDHCP: true
      enableIPv6RA: true
    ```

2. Register the `managedTap` Network Binding Plugin in KubeVirt:

    ```bash
    # kubectl patch kubevirts -n kubevirt kubevirt --type=json -p=\
    '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/configuration/network",   "value": {
        "binding": {
            "managedtap": {
                "domainAttachmentType": "managedTap"
            }
        }
    }}]'
    ```

3. Create a virtual machine, specifying the use of the `managedTap` network type:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
    kind: VirtualMachine
    metadata:
      name: dual-stack-vm
      namespace: default
    spec:
      running: false
      template:
        spec:
          domain:
            devices:
              interfaces:
                - name: default
                  binding:
                    name: managedtap
            networks:
            - name: default
              pod: {}
    ```

By following these steps, VMs can obtain their corresponding IPv4/IPv6 addresses through the DHCP and IPv6 RA protocols.
